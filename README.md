## Introduction/Project Overview
Welcome to Data Engineering Capstone Project 1 â€“ Analyzing COVID-19 Data. In this project, we delve into the analysis of sample data related to COVID-19 cases recorded between January 2019 and December 2020. The dataset, provided in CSV format, enables us to gain insights into the pandemic's impact.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to analyze and gain insights from COVID-19 data. This includes creating a dedicated database and table within it to house the dataset, converting data types, and performing Extraction and Load (EL) techniques to load the data into the database.

## Data Summary
Fetch the summary of the table datatypes for each column.

## Instructions
Follow these instructions to achieve project goals:

1. **Database Creation**: Create a PostgreSQL database named 'covid_19_data' to store the COVID-19 dataset.

2. **Table Creation**: Within the 'covid_19_data' database, create a table named 'covid_19_data' using the appropriate data types for each column as indicated in the data summary.

3. **Data Type Modification**: Change the data type of the 'ObservationDate' column to 'DATE' within the DataFrame.

4. **Data Extraction and Loading**: Use Python to read the 'Covid_19_data.csv' file and load it into the 'covid_19_data' table in the PostgreSQL database. Utilize the `psycopg2` and `SQLAlchemy` libraries to interact with the database.

5. **SQL Queries**: Use PostgreSQL PGAdmin to create and execute SQL queries. Present all queries within a single SQL file.

## How It Works
1. **Database Creation**: Use PgAdmin to create a new PostgreSQL database named 'covid_19_data'.

2. **Table Creation**: Within the 'covid_19_data' database, create a table named 'covid_19_data' using the data summary's column names and data types.

3. **Data Type Modification**: Change the data type of the 'ObservationDate' column to 'DATE' within the DataFrame.

4. **Data Extraction and Loading**: Read the 'Covid_19_data.csv' file using Pandas. Use the `psycopg2` and `SQLAlchemy` libraries to connect to the PostgreSQL database and load the data into the 'covid_19_data' table.

## Loading the Data
The data loading process involves using Python and the `psycopg2` and `SQLAlchemy` libraries to extract the COVID-19 data from the CSV file and load it into the PostgreSQL database.

## Requirements
Ensure the following requirements are met:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- SQLAlchemy library
- PostgreSQL database

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project involved the analysis of COVID-19 data using PostgreSQL as the chosen database tool. The dataset was transformed and loaded into the 'covid_19_data' database table using Python, Pandas, `psycopg2`, and `SQLAlchemy`. The project's SQL queries were executed using PostgreSQL PGAdmin for deeper insights.
